# Loan Default Analysis  


## Project Overview
* The objective is to analyze customer behavior and financial metrics to identify potential default risks. The K-means clustering ML algorithm analyses loan defaults using customer and financial data. 

## Dataset
* The dataset used in this project is sourced from the following URL:

https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%204/data/Cust_Segmentation.csv


* This dataset includes several features such as:

Age: The age of the customer in years. <br>
Education: The level of education attained by the customer, represented numerically (1:lower - 5:higher) <br>
Years Employed: The total number of years the customer has been employed. <br>
Income: The annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars. <br>
Card Debt: The amount of credit card debt held by the customer in thousands of dollars. <br>
Other Debt: The total amount of other debts the customer has in thousands of dollars. <br>
Defaulted: Indicates whether the customer has defaulted on loans or debts (0: No, 1: Yes).<br>
Debt-Income Ratio: The ratio of the customer's total debt to their income (higher: greater debt relative to income)
